/**    Object for Counting: An object called occurrences is used to keep track of the count for each unique element.
    Counting Logic:
        If the element already exists in the object, increment its count.
        If it doesnâ€™t exist, initialize its count to 1.
    Printing the Results: After counting, we use Object.entries() to iterate over the entries of the occurrences object and print each element with its count.
